Description: Several R packages compute pedigree likelihoods, including
    'pedprobr', 'Familias', and (the non-R) software 'MERLIN'. This
    purpose of this package is to facilitate comparisons of these
    programs, both in terms of numeric accuracy and timings. The
    'pedtools' package is used as starting point for creating pedigrees
    and markers, which are then converted to other formats as needed.
