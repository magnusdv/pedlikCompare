Description: Several R packages compute pedigree likelihoods, including 
  'pedprobr', 'paramlink', 'Familias', 'ElstonStewart'. Outside of R, a widely 
  used program is 'MERLIN'. This purpose of this package is to facilitate 
  comparisons of these programs, both in terms of numeric accuracy and 
  timings. The 'pedtools' package is used as starting point for creating
  pedigrees and markers, which are then converted to other formats as 
  needed.
