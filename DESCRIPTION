Description: Several R packages compute pedigree likelihoods, including
    'pedprobr', 'paramlink', 'Familias', 'ElstonStewart'. Outside of R, a
    widely used program is 'MERLIN'. This purpose of this package is to
    facilitate comparisons of these programs, both in terms of numeric
    accuracy and timings. The 'pedtools' package is used as starting point
    for creating pedigrees and markers, which are then converted to other
    formats as needed.
